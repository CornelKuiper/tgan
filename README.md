GAN network for creating the best tweets ever

For training the GAN for text generation you will need the lstm_wgp.py file as well as the trump_embedding_dynamic.npy. The files can be found on the stackstorage at https://cornol.stackstorage.com/s/24vIW0WM69GOI3J.
For training the discriminator for classification of tweets (Trump or not Trump) you will need the lstm_d.py file and the data in shuffled.zip found on the stackstorage at https://cornol.stackstorage.com/s/24vIW0WM69GOI3J. This zip-file contains data and its corresponding labels spread over different .npy files.

In both cases make sure you have the path in the python files set to the correct folder.
